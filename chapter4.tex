\chapter{Comparison and Evaluation}

\epigraph{\textit{\small{The thing I don't like about tomato sauce is the tomatoes}}}{``Oliwka N.''}

The original intention of this section was to compare the performance of the Apertium-based system
with an SMT system; however, as the rule conversion remains incomplete, no comparison is possible.

Despite the development of a tool for corpus cleaning, there was little in the two problematic
corpora that could be targetted; to check what effect, if any, cleaning the corpus would have,
I used the script distributed with Moses that removes sentence pairs whose relative length
differs by a ratio of 9:1 or more.

Secondly, to compare the effect of proper lower casing, I compared the cleaned corpus when lowercased
using the default method, and with the method for Irish. The results of the three phrase-based systems
and the Neural MT system are presented in figure~\ref{fig:tokcleancompare}.

For comparison, the results on the various subcorpora listed in the previous chapter are reproduced
from \citet[p. 569]{ARCAN16.9} in figure~\ref{fig:iriseval}.
